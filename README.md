# VisageSecure-

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for an advanced bank security system designed to enhance safety measures during ATM cash withdrawals. The system leverages camera technology and sophisticated image processing algorithms to assess the facial coverage percentage of individuals accessing ATMs. Based on this metric, dynamic security adjustments are made, ensuring a robust and adaptive safeguarding mechanism for financial transactions.

## Features

- **Facial Coverage Assessment**: The system uses camera technology and image processing algorithms to quantify the extent of facial visibility of individuals accessing ATMs.

- **Dynamic Security Adjustments**: Security measures are adjusted dynamically based on the observed facial coverage percentage. This ensures that security measures are proportionally enhanced in response to the level of facial coverage.

- **Adaptive Safeguarding Mechanism**: The system adapts its security measures to ensure the safety of financial transactions, providing a robust defense against potential threats.


## Usage

1. **Accessing ATMs**: Users can access ATMs for cash withdrawals as usual.

2. **Facial Coverage Assessment**: The system will continuously monitor facial coverage percentage using camera technology and image processing algorithms.

3. **Dynamic Security Adjustments**: Based on the observed facial coverage percentage, the system will dynamically adjust security measures to ensure the safety of financial transactions.

4. **Robust and Adaptive Safeguarding**: The system provides a robust and adaptive safeguarding mechanism, enhancing security measures in proportion to the level of facial coverage.
